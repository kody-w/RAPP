# RAPP v1 — Specification

> **Memorialized:** 2026-04-17
> **Status:** Frozen. v1 is the canonical reference. All future versions must remain backwards-compatible with the v1 agent contract.
> **Companion doctrine:** [Single File Agents — rappterhub](https://kody-w.github.io/rappterhub/single-file-agents.html)
> **Live at:** [kody-w.com](https://kody-w.com) · [kody-w.github.io/RAPP](https://kody-w.github.io/RAPP/)

## 0. The Sacred Tenet

> **The single-file `*_agent.py` is sacred.**
>
> 🧬 **The file IS the agent IS the documentation IS the contract.**
>
> One file. One class. One `perform()` method. One metadata dict.
> Zero build steps. Zero frameworks. Zero ceremony.
> Zero drift between what the skill says and what the code does.
>
> An agent that requires more than a single Python (or TypeScript) file is not a RAPP agent.

Everything else in this specification — the brainstem, the cloud tier, Copilot Studio, federation, soul files, sources panels, ARM templates, RAR, data sloshing — exists **to serve the single-file agent**. If a future feature breaks this contract, the feature is wrong.

This is the inviolable law of RAPP v1. It is what makes a 14-year-old able to ship an agent on day one, and what makes an enterprise able to ship the same file to 500,000 seats on day 100.

## 1. Why Single File Agents

### 1.1 The problem with skills alone

Every major AI agent framework has arrived at the same idea: **skills** — a Markdown file describing what an agent should do. Skills are portable, human-readable, shareable. But they have a fundamental flaw:

> ⚠️ **Skills are not deterministic.**

A skill tells an AI _what_ to do. It does not tell it _how_. You are trusting the model to interpret, implement, and execute correctly — every single time. It won't.

The industry progression is predictable and has already played out:

1. **Skills launch.** "Just write Markdown and the AI does it!"
2. **Quality issues emerge.** The same skill produces different results each run.
3. **Plugins get added.** "OK, let the skill call deterministic code." Now there are two files.
4. **Security surfaces.** Malicious skills appear. No contract, no structure — freeform text the AI trusts blindly.
5. **Convergence.** You need documentation AND code AND a contract, in one portable unit.

RAPP v1 is the convergence point. A **Single File Agent** is exactly what it sounds like: one file containing everything an agent needs to exist — its documentation, its metadata contract, and its deterministic code.

### 1.2 The three layers in one file

| Layer | What it is | Who reads it |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 📋 **Metadata contract** | Native `dict` / `object` — name, description, parameters, JSON schema. Versionable. | The LLM orchestrator, the runtime, CI. |
| 📖 **Markdown docs** | The "skill" — what it does, how to use it, examples, edge cases. | Humans AND AI. |
| ⚙️ **Executable code** | Deterministic `perform()` — same input, same output. Testable, auditable. | The runtime, test suites. |

All three layers live in a single `.py` or `.ts` file. There is no separation to manage, no files to keep in sync, no drift between what the skill says and what the code does.

---

## 2. The Five Principles

A RAPP v1 agent, in any language, MUST satisfy all five.

### 2.1 🎯 Deterministic

An agent's `perform()` does the same thing every time for the same inputs. **The AI orchestrator decides _when_ to call it — the agent decides _how_ to execute.** This is the load-bearing architectural split of RAPP: probabilistic selection, deterministic execution.

### 2.2 📦 Self-Describing

The file contains its own documentation, its own contract, and its own implementation. Drop it anywhere and it works. No external manifest. No companion files. No `AGENT.md`. No `package.json` per-agent. No YAML sidecar.

### 2.3 🔒 Bounded

The metadata dict defines exactly what parameters the agent accepts. The code defines exactly what it does with them. There are no surprises — **an agent can't go through doors it wasn't given.** The schema is the lock and the key.

### 2.4 🧬 Evolvable

Single file agents can be generated, molted, and versioned through natural language. "Make my news agent also include Reddit." The agent evolves — the contract stays clean. The meta-agent `LearnNew` creates new single file agents from prose and hot-loads them immediately.

### 2.5 🔗 Chainable

Agents output `data_slush` — curated signals from live results that feed into the next agent's context automatically. No LLM interpreter is needed between steps. This is how deterministic execution composes at scale.

---

## 5. The Agent Contract (The Sacred Spec)

This is the most important section of this document. **Every RAPP-compatible runtime in v1 must accept agents that conform to this contract, and only this contract.**

### 5.1 Python form

A single file, named `<thing>_agent.py`, placed in an `agents/` directory:

```python
import json
from openrappter.agents.basic_agent import BasicAgent

class WeatherPoetAgent(BasicAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = 'WeatherPoet'
        self.metadata = {
            "name": self.name,
            "description": "Fetches weather and writes haiku poetry",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "query": {"type": "string", "description": "City name to get weather for"}
                },
                "required": []
            }
        }
        super().__init__(name=self.name, metadata=self.metadata)

    def perform(self, **kwargs):
        query = kwargs.get('query', '')
        weather = self.fetch_weather(query)
        haiku = self.compose_haiku(weather)
        return json.dumps({
            "status": "success",
            "haiku": haiku,
            "data_slush": {"mood": weather["condition"], "temp_f": weather["temp"]}
        })
```

### 5.2 TypeScript form

Same pattern, same clarity — no YAML, no static strings to parse:

```typescript
export class ShellAgent extends BasicAgent {
  constructor() {
    const metadata: AgentMetadata = {
      name: 'Shell',
      description: 'Execute shell commands and file operations',
      parameters: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: { command: { type: 'string', description: 'Shell command to execute' } },
        required: []
      }
    };
    super('Shell', metadata);
  }

  async perform(kwargs: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<string> {
    // this.context → enriched by data sloshing
    ...
  }
}
```

### 5.3 The four required attributes

| Attribute | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `self.name` / `this.name` | `str` | Tool name surfaced to the LLM |
| `self.metadata` / constructor `metadata` | `dict` / `object` | OpenAI-style function-calling JSON schema |
| `super().__init__(name, metadata)` | call | Registers the agent with the runtime |
| `perform(**kwargs) -> str` | method | The tool body — receives the schema's `properties` and returns a string |

### 5.4 The `data_slush` output convention

An agent's `perform()` SHOULD return a JSON string shaped like:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "<payload_key>": "<human-facing result>",
  "data_slush": { "<signal_key>": "<curated value for next agent>" }
}
```

`data_slush` is the bridge between agents. It feeds directly into the next agent's `self.context` in a chain, with zero LLM interpretation required between steps. This is how deterministic execution composes.

### 5.5 What an agent MUST NOT do

- Must NOT require a build step.
- Must NOT depend on a framework other than `BasicAgent`.
- Must NOT import sibling files within the same `agents/` directory (each agent is independent).
- Must NOT mutate the runtime's global state outside what `perform()` returns.
- Must NOT require runtime configuration that is not in `self.metadata` or environment variables.

### 5.6 What an agent MAY do

- Make outbound HTTP requests, hit databases, call other LLMs, shell out, write files, send mail.
- Declare pip (or npm) dependencies at the top of the file. The runtime auto-installs missing deps when the file is loaded.
- Read environment variables for secrets. The runtime injects the host environment.
- Return Markdown-formatted strings. The chat UI renders Markdown.
- Return structured JSON with a `data_slush` field for chaining.

### 5.7 Discovery rules

- Any file matching `agents/*_agent.py` (or `*Agent.ts`) is loaded at startup.
- Files added at runtime via the **Sources** panel (a remote GitHub repo URL) are hot-loaded.
- Discovery is by filename suffix only — there is no manifest file.
- One file = one agent. There is no multi-agent file.

### 5.8 The portability guarantee

**An agent file that runs in Tier 1 must run unmodified in Tier 2 and Tier 3.**

This is the single hardest requirement in the entire RAPP spec, and it is the requirement that gives RAPP its value. A `weather_agent.py` you write on your laptop today must:

- Run locally against `localhost:7071` (Tier 1)
- Deploy unchanged to your CommunityRAPP Function App (Tier 2)
- Be invoked from Microsoft Teams via Copilot Studio (Tier 3)

If a future change to the spec, the runtime, or the cloud backend breaks this guarantee, the change is rejected. v1 is frozen on this point.

---

## 6. Implicit Context: Data Sloshing

Every single file agent inherits **data sloshing** — automatic context enrichment before `perform()` runs. The agent wakes up already knowing:

| Layer | What it knows | Where it's surfaced |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| ⏰ **Temporal** | Time of day, day of week, fiscal period, urgency signals | `self.context.temporal` |
| 🧠 **Memory** | Relevant past interactions surfaced by overlap | `self.context.memory` |
| 🎯 **Query** | Specificity, ownership hints, temporal references | `self.context.query` |
| 👤 **Behavioral** | User's technical level, brevity preference | `self.context.behavioral` |
| 🧊 **Upstream slush** | Live signals from the previous agent in a chain | `self.context.slush` |

The agent doesn't ask for this context. It doesn't configure it. It's just _there_, in `self.context`, before the first line of `perform()` executes. This is what makes the pattern biological — the agent wakes up oriented, not blank.

---

## 7. The Soul File

A single Markdown file (`soul.md`) that defines the agent's personality, voice, and operating constraints. Loaded at startup as the system prompt.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Format** | Markdown |
| **Path** | `./soul.md` (override with `SOUL_PATH` env var) |
| **Loaded** | Once at server start; reload via `/health` recycle |
| **Per-tenant** | One soul per brainstem instance. No per-conversation soul mutation in v1. |

The soul is sacred too, but softer: it is the "you" of the agent. The collection of `*_agent.py` files is the "what you can do." The soul is the "who you are." Together they form the tenant.

---

## 8. The HTTP Surface

The brainstem exposes exactly five endpoints in v1. Tiers 2 and 3 MUST implement at least `/chat` and `/health` with identical request/response shapes.

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/chat` | POST | `{"user_input": str, "conversation_history": list, "session_id": str}` → assistant response |
| `/health` | GET | Status, model, loaded agents, token state |
| `/login` | POST | Start GitHub device code OAuth flow (Tier 1 only) |
| `/models` | GET | List available models |
| `/repos` | GET | List connected agent repos (Sources) |

Future versions MAY add endpoints. They MUST NOT change the shape of these five.

---

## 9. Configuration Surface

Every variable has a sensible default. A zero-config install must work.

| Variable | Default | Tier | Description |
|----------|---------|------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | auto-detected via `gh` CLI | 1 | GitHub PAT or Copilot token |
| `GITHUB_MODEL` | `gpt-4o` | 1 | GitHub Models id |
| `SOUL_PATH` | `./soul.md` | 1, 2 | Path to the soul file |
| `AGENTS_PATH` | `./agents` | 1, 2 | Path to the agents directory |
| `PORT` | `7071` | 1 | Server port |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | n/a | 2 | Azure OpenAI resource endpoint |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` | n/a | 2 | GPT-4o deployment name |
| `STORAGE_CONNECTION` | n/a | 2 | Azure Storage connection string |

---

## 10. Tenancy Model

> **One tenant = one soul + one agents directory.**

A tenant in RAPP v1 is the smallest unit of identity. It consists of:

1. A `soul.md` system prompt
2. An `agents/` directory of one or more single file agents
3. A persistent storage location (filesystem in Tier 1, Storage Account in Tier 2)

A brainstem instance hosts exactly one tenant in v1. A CommunityRAPP project is one tenant per project directory. A Copilot Studio agent is one tenant per imported solution.

**Multi-tenancy is achieved by deploying multiple instances, not by partitioning a single instance.** This is intentional. It keeps the data model boring, the security model trivial, and the failure domain small.

---

## 11. Agent Generation (Molt)

The pattern gets more powerful when agents generate other agents. The `LearnNew` meta-agent creates single file agents from natural language:

> 💬 _"Learn a new agent that fetches Hacker News stories and summarizes the top 5"_

`LearnNew` generates a complete single file agent — metadata, documentation, and working code — writes it to the `agents/` directory, and hot-loads it for immediate use. Because the output is a single file with a deterministic contract, generated agents are:

- **Publishable** — push directly to RAR (no separate manifest to write)
- **Testable** — standard unit tests against `perform()`
- **Auditable** — read one file to understand everything the agent can do
- **Moltable** — evolve through feedback: "add Reddit sources" → new generation, same contract

This is evolution inside the system. The contract stays constant; the capabilities compound.

---

## 12. RAR — The RAPP Agent Registry

> Referenced, not twinned. RAR lives at [kody-w/RAR](https://github.com/kody-w/RAR) and is the canonical reference registry implementation of the v1 single file agent contract.

**RAR** (RAPP Agent Registry) is the reference package registry for v1. It is to single file agents what npm is to JavaScript packages — but local-first, single-file, and offline-capable. No `node_modules`. No build step. No server required. Every agent in RAR is a single `.py` file with an embedded `__manifest__`. `git clone` the registry and you have everything — it works from `file://`, in a cabin, with no internet.

### 12.1 Canonical facts

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Repo** | [kody-w/RAR](https://github.com/kody-w/RAR) |
| **Site** | [kody-w.github.io/RAR](https://kody-w.github.io/RAR) |
| **Registry index** | [`registry.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/registry.json) |
| **Machine API manifest** | [`api.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/api.json) |
| **AI skill interface** | [`skill.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/skill.md) |
| **SDK (zero-dep, single-file)** | [`rapp_sdk.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/rapp_sdk.py) |
| **Agent template** | [`template_agent.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/template_agent.py) |
| **Agent base class** | `BasicAgent` (`@rapp/basic_agent`) |
| **Package path** | `agents/@publisher/slug.py` |
| **Naming** | `snake_case` everywhere — filenames, manifest names, dependencies. No dashes. |

### 12.2 The `__manifest__` schema

v1 recognizes one additional convention for registry-ready agents: an embedded `__manifest__` dict at module scope, tagged `"schema": "rapp-agent/1.0"`. The manifest is strictly additive to Section 5's contract — a file with a manifest is still a valid v1 agent, and a v1 agent without a manifest is still runnable in a brainstem. The manifest makes the agent **registry-addressable**.

```python
__manifest__ = {
    "schema": "rapp-agent/1.0",
    "name": "@publisher/slug",            # package id — snake_case slug
    "version": "1.0.0",                   # semver
    "display_name": "Human-Facing Name",
    "description": "One sentence.",
    "author": "Your Name",
    "tags": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
    "category": "general",                # one of the 19 canonical categories
    "quality_tier": "community",          # community | verified | official
    "requires_env": [],                   # env vars the agent needs
}
```

### 12.3 The SDK surface

`rapp_sdk.py` is a zero-dependency single file. Every command supports `--json` for machine orchestration.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `new @pub/slug` | Scaffold agent from template |
| `validate path.py` | Validate the manifest + contract |
| `test path.py` | Run contract tests |
| `submit path.py` | Submit to RAR (auto-registers binder if needed) |
| `card resolve NAME\|SEED\|INCANTATION` | Resolve a card from name, 64-bit seed, or 7-word incantation |
| `card words NAME` | Get the 7-word incantation for any agent |
| `egg forge @a @b @c` | Compress a set of agents into a shareable string |
| `egg hatch STRING` | Reconstruct agents from a compact egg string |

### 12.4 Sanctioned extensions (v1-compatible)

RAR introduces four concepts that are **sanctioned but optional** under v1. An implementation is v1-compliant without any of them; implementations that adopt them inherit the following definitions:

- **Card** — a visual, collectible projection of an agent file (types, stats, abilities, art). Every agent has at most one card.
- **Seed** — a deterministic 64-bit number that reconstructs the full card offline. The card's entire visual state can be rebuilt from the seed alone.
- **Incantation** — the 7-word English phrase that maps 1:1 to a seed (e.g. `TWIST MOLD BEQUEST VALOR LEFT ORBIT RUNE`). Speakable via the Web Speech API; the binder listens and the card self-assembles.
- **Binder** — a personal card collection. Offline via IndexedDB + localStorage. Mobile-first, PWA-capable. Export/import as `binder.json`.
- **Egg** — a compact serialization format that encodes a set of agents into a shareable string. Forge on one device, hatch on another.

These extensions exist to serve the sacred tenet from a different angle: if the file is the agent, then a seed is the file, and an incantation is the seed. Portability all the way down to seven spoken words.

### 12.5 How it composes with v1

| v1 concept | RAR instance |
|------------|--------------|
| Sacred tenet — single file agent | Every RAR package is exactly one `.py` file |
| Self-describing (§2.2) | The `__manifest__` lives inside the file |
| Bounded (§2.3) | The manifest `parameters` schema is the lock |
| Evolvable (§2.4) | `version` bump + resubmit = molt |
| Chainable (§2.5) | `data_slush` flows through chains in a binder |
| The three tiers (§4) | A RAR agent installs into any of the three |
| `BasicAgent` (§5.1) | RAR's `@rapp/basic_agent` is the reference base |
| Agent generation (§11) | `rapp_sdk.py new` scaffolds; `LearnNew` generates in-brainstem |

### 12.6 Submission path (one command)

```bash
# Fetch the SDK
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/rapp_sdk.py

# Scaffold + submit
python rapp_sdk.py new @yourname/my_cool_agent
python rapp_sdk.py submit agents/@yourname/my_cool_agent.py
```

The SDK validates, auto-registers the publisher's binder on first submit, opens a staging PR, and — once approved — the forge mints the card into `registry.json`. Updates are a `version` bump plus a resubmit.

### 12.7 Registry as compliance oracle

The registry is sanctioned by v1 as the canonical distribution channel and the de-facto compliance oracle. An agent that validates under `rapp_sdk.py validate` is, by definition, a valid RAPP v1 agent. If a runtime accepts an agent from the registry and cannot execute it, the runtime is non-compliant — not the agent.

---

## 13. Federation (informational)

RAPP v1 does not standardize federation. However, the spec acknowledges three patterns observed in the wild:

- **Source federation** — pulling agent files from remote GitHub repos via the Sources panel. Sanctioned.
- **Tier handoff** — a Tier 1 brainstem calling a Tier 2 CommunityRAPP `/chat` endpoint as a sub-agent. Sanctioned.
- **Cross-tenant calls** — one tenant invoking another tenant's `/chat`. Permitted but not standardized; treat the other tenant as a remote HTTP API.
- **Chain composition** — agents piping `data_slush` to one another. Standardized (Section 5.4).

Future versions will address federation more directly. v1's stance: do not constrain a pattern still being discovered.

---

## 14. Versioning Policy

RAPP v1 is **frozen**. The agent contract (Section 5), the HTTP surface (Section 8), the configuration surface (Section 9), and the `data_slush` convention (Section 5.4) will not change in any v1.x.y release.

A change to any of those sections requires a major version bump (RAPP v2). v2 is permitted to break compatibility, but a v2 runtime SHOULD ship a compatibility shim that runs v1 agents unmodified — because **the agent file is sacred**.

| Change | Allowed in v1 patches? |
|--------|------------------------|
| Bug fixes in Tier 1/2/3 implementations | Yes |
| New optional configuration variables | Yes |
| New optional HTTP endpoints | Yes |
| New tier (e.g. mobile) that implements the contract | Yes |
| New languages with their own `BasicAgent` base class | Yes, if they satisfy the Five Principles |
| Changes to the agent class signature | **No** — v2 only |
| Changes to `/chat` request or response shape | **No** — v2 only |
| Removing any required attribute on `BasicAgent` | **No** — v2 only |
| Breaking the `data_slush` shape | **No** — v2 only |

---

## 15. The Roadmap (already playing out)

The AI ecosystem is currently living through this progression. RAPP v1 is already at step 5.

1. ✅ **Skills** — flat text files. Mainstream. (Already commoditized.)
2. 🔄 **Plugins** — deterministic code called by skills. Arriving now across every vendor.
3. 🔜 **Unified format** — skill + plugin + contract merged into one file. _This is the single file agent._
4. 🔜 **Agent registries** — sharing and installing. _This is [RAR](https://kody-w.github.io/RAR)._
5. 🔜 **Agent generation** — AI creating agents that create agents. _This is LearnNew + molt._

RAPP is not predicting this. RAPP is the artifact left behind from running this loop in production for over a year.

---

## 16. The Digital Twin

This specification, the landing page at [kody-w.com](https://kody-w.com), the [`archive/engine`](https://github.com/kody-w/RAPP/tree/archive/engine) branch of this repo, and the canonical [Single File Agents doctrine page](https://kody-w.github.io/rappterhub/single-file-agents.html) together form the **digital twin** of RAPP v1.

The twin is intentionally static. It is not a running system; it is a memorial of a running system, captured at the moment v1 was declared frozen. Its job is to outlive the running system — so any future runtime, in any future language, on any future cloud, can be checked against this document and judged compliant or not.

The twin has four parts:

1. **`index.html`** — the experiential twin. What a visitor sees and tries.
2. **`SPEC.md`** *(this file)* — the contractual twin. What an implementer must obey.
3. **Single File Agents doctrine** — the philosophical twin. Why the contract has the shape it has.
4. **`archive/engine` branch** — the genetic twin. The code that ran when v1 shipped.

**Tie-break order:** if they disagree, SPEC wins over doctrine, doctrine wins over index, index wins over engine. The contract is the platform; the engine is one implementation of many.

---

## 17. The Closing Statement

RAPP v1 is small on purpose. Three tiers. Five endpoints. One file per agent. One soul per tenant. Five principles. One registry. Everything else is convenience.

The reason RAPP exists is to make agent development feel like writing a Python script in 2014 — open a file, write a function, run it. Everything cloud, everything enterprise, everything multi-surface, has to fit around that feeling, not on top of it.

The sacred tenet, restated:

> 🧬 **The file IS the agent IS the documentation IS the contract.**
>
> **The single-file `*_agent.py` is sacred.**
> Protect it. Future versions will be judged by whether the file you wrote on your laptop today still runs unchanged on whatever runs RAPP next.

_Memorialized 2026-04-17, at the moment v1 was declared frozen._
