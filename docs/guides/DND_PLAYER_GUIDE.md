📍 Location: The Prancing Pony Inn, Greendale Village

You find yourself in the warm common room of the Prancing Pony...
[Full campaign introduction]

💡 WHAT DO YOU DO?
```

**First Actions:**
```
Player: "I talk to Tobias the innkeeper for more details about the missing girl"

DM: 💬 Conversation with Tobias Goodbarrel

You: "Tell me more about Elara's daughter. What was she doing near the ruins?"

Tobias: "Ah, young Miriel... she's always been curious about herbs and plants.
The old ruins have rare moonblossom that only grows in ancient stone. She went
three days ago at dawn, should've been back by midday. Her mother's beside herself
with worry. The ruins... they've been abandoned for centuries, but lately, we've
heard strange chanting at night, seen unnatural lights. Something's not right there."

💡 Continue the conversation or use 'take_action' to do something else.
```

**Investigating:**
```
Player: "I want to check my equipment and prepare for the journey to the ruins"

DM: You methodically check your gear. Your longbow is well-strung, arrows sharp
and true. The leather armor fits comfortably, and your trusty shortsword sits
ready at your hip. As an experienced Outlander, you know to pack extra rations
and water. You're ready for whatever dangers await at the ruins.

The path north is clearly marked. It's about an hour's walk through the forest.
```

**Journey:**
```
Player: "I head to the ruins, keeping alert for any dangers"

DM: 🎲 Perception check: 18 (d20: 15 + 3) - SUCCESS!

As you move through the forest with practiced stealth, your keen elven eyes spot
fresh tracks - goblin prints, at least four of them, heading toward the ruins.
The tracks are only hours old. You also notice broken branches and signs of a
struggle near the path.

You can see the ruins ahead through the trees - crumbling stone walls covered
in moss and ivy. Strange purple light flickers from within.
```

**Combat Encounter:**
```
Player: "I sneak closer to get a better look"

DM: 🎲 Stealth check: 20 (d20: 17 + 3) - SUCCESS!

You move like a shadow through the undergrowth. As you peer through a gap in the
wall, you see them: three goblins arguing over a small cage. Inside the cage,
you can make out a young woman with herb baskets - Miriel!

One goblin notices movement...

⚔️ COMBAT INITIATED! ⚔️
3 Goblins appear before you!
🎲 Roll for initiative: 19

🎉 Victory! Combat has ended.
Total XP gained: 150 XP
```

**Rescue:**
```
Player: "I approach the cage and try to free Miriel"

DM: You rush to the cage. Miriel looks up with tears of relief. "Thank the gods!
I thought... I thought they were going to sacrifice me to something in the depths
below." She points to a dark staircase leading down into the ruins.

As you work on the lock, you hear a deep, rumbling growl from below. Whatever
the goblins were working for is still down there...

Do you investigate the depths, or escort Miriel back to safety first?
```

**Choice:**
```
Player: "I'll take Miriel back to the village first. I can return to investigate later."

DM: Wisdom in protecting the innocent. You help Miriel to her feet and escort her
safely back through the forest. Her mother Elara weeps with joy at the reunion.

Tobias rewards you with the promised 50 gold pieces, and the village elder adds
another 25 for your bravery. "But please," he says gravely, "discover what evil
lurks in those ruins before it threatens us all."

✨ Quest "The Missing Girl" - COMPLETED!
✨ +100 XP (Total: 250/300 for Level 2)
💰 +75 gold (Total: 115 gp)

🎲 Would you like to rest before returning to the ruins, or investigate immediately?
```
